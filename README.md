# Geotagged Tweets : Data Science
>A project containing geo-tagged tweets from Twitter API

I chose to explore the topic of "data science" in three varying locations: University of Washington/Seattle, University of Minnesota/Minneapolis, and the New York University/New York. I searched for tweets since 1/15/2022, looking for the term "data science". I took latitude and longitude numbers from each university and set the radius to however far the bounds of the city was. 

I was curious to see how different attitudes were towards data science from each part of the United States (Northwest, Central, and East). To my surprise, there was a large difference in all word clouds. In New York, we see large words like "stock", "channel", "video". Things like that which promote social media websites about data science and learning. After further inspection of the csv, I realized that there was one channel in New York that really liked to promote his content on Twitter and had multiple tweets over the last seven days. In Seattle, we see lots of words like "webinar", "tutorials", "free". It appears that like New York, Seattleites also partake in learning and spreading content. In Minneapolis, words start to change and we no longer see terms that refer to online classes or tutorials. Instead, we see more terms like "natural", "make", and even "modeling". 

I believe that there is such a stark contrast between the two larger cities versus Minneapolis because of culture. I think that more content creators exist in Seattle and New York because these cities are on much larger scales than Minneapolis in terms of population. 

In the future, I believe that this research could be improved by filtering for more words: perhaps people in other regions refer to data science as ds. I also would much prefer to look for tweets past the last seven days if possible, but Twitter API has changed and made it impossible. 

I thought it was really interesting how New York and Seattle's word clouds were so different from Minneapolis. It's really cool to see how regions affect people's tweets. In the New York and Seattle tweets, I found a lot more people who were arguing over politics using data science as compared to Minneapolis, which had more student population tweeting.
